    <h1>Flow Content</h1>
    <p>Flow content is the most common type of content in HTML documents. It includes elements that can be used to
        structure the main body of a document.
        Flow content can contain other flow content, as well as sectioning content, heading content, and more.</p>
    <p>Examples of flow content include paragraphs, headings, lists, images, and more. It is the default type of content
        that you will use when creating web pages.</p>
    <p>Flow content can be nested within other flow content, allowing for complex layouts and structures. It is
        essential for creating the main structure of a webpage, as it allows for the inclusion of text, images, and
        other media in a coherent manner.</p>
