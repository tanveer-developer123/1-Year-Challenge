    <!-- Topic of Title  -->
    <h1>Topic of &lt;title&gt;</h1>
    <p>
        The &lt;title&gt; tag is used to define the title of the HTML document. This title is displayed in the browser's
        title bar or tab and is also used by search engines as the main title for the page in search results.</p>
    <p>It is important for SEO and user experience, as it gives users an idea of what the page is about before they
        click on it.</p>
    <p>The title should be concise, descriptive, and relevant to the content of the page
    </p>

    <!-- Topic of <link> -->
    <h1>Topic of &lt;link&gt;</h1>
    <p>
        The &lt;link&gt; tag is used to link external resources to the HTML document, such as stylesheets, icons, and
        other files. It is typically placed within the &lt;head&gt; section of the document.</p>
    <p>Here is an example of how to use the &lt;link&gt; tag to include a stylesheet:</p>
    <pre>
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"&gt;
        </pre>
    <p>In this example, the &lt;link&gt; tag is used to link to an external CSS file named "styles.css". The "rel"
        attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked resource, which in this case is
        "stylesheet".
    <p>
        The &lt;link&gt; tag can also be used to link to other types of resources, such as icons or alternate
        stylesheets.
        For example, to link to a favicon (the small icon displayed in the browser tab), you can use the following code:
    </p>
    <pre>
&lt;link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="favicon.ico"&gt;
    </pre>

    <h1>Topic of &lt;style&gt;</h1>
    <p>
        The &lt;style&gt; tag is used to define internal CSS styles for the HTML document. It is typically placed within
        the &lt;head&gt; section and allows you to apply styles directly to the elements of the page.
    </p>
    <p>Here is an example of how to use the &lt;style&gt; tag:</p>
    <pre>
&lt;style&gt;
    body {
        background-color: #f0f0f0;
        font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
    }
    h1 {
        color: #333;
    }
    &lt;/style&gt;
</pre>
    <h1>Topic of &lt;script&gt;</h1>
    <p>
        The &lt;script&gt; tag is used to include JavaScript code in the HTML document. It can be placed either in the
        &lt;head&gt; section or at the end of the &lt;body&gt; section, depending on when you want the script to be
        executed.
    <pre>
&lt;script&gt;
    console.log("Hello, World!");
&lt;/script&gt;
        </pre>
    <p>
        This is where you can write your JavaScript code. It will be executed when the page loads.
    </p>
