# Enhanced Admin Dashboard Features

## 🎯 New Features Overview

This enhanced version includes advanced role-based access control, user activity tracking, and a comprehensive admin system.

## 🔐 Root Admin Password System

### How It Works
- **Admin Role Requires Authorization**: When signing up as Admin, users must enter a root admin password
- **Validation**: The password is validated against a configured root password
- **Security**: Only authorized personnel can create admin accounts

### Configuration
The root admin password is stored in `src/config/admin.ts`:

```typescript
ROOT_ADMIN_PASSWORD: 'RootAdmin@2024'
```

**⚠️ IMPORTANT FOR PRODUCTION:**
1. Change this password immediately
2. Store it in environment variables
3. Never commit the actual password to version control
4. Use server-side validation in production

### Usage
1. Go to `/signup`
2. Select "Admin" role
3. A warning message appears with password field
4. Enter the root admin password: `RootAdmin@2024`
5. Complete signup

## 👨‍💼 Development Admin Account

### Default Credentials
- **Email**: `admin@admin.com`
- **Password**: `admin`
- **Status**: Development Only

### Features
- Pre-configured admin account for testing
- Marked as "Development Only" in the system
- Requires password change on first login (feature ready)
- Should be disabled/removed in production

### How to Use
1. Go to `/login`
2. Enter email: `admin@admin.com`
3. Enter password: `admin`
4. You'll be logged in as admin

### Security Notes
- This account is for development/testing ONLY
- Remove or disable before deploying to production
- Change the password immediately if keeping it

## 🎓 Admin Community Page

   - Create: Any authenticated user
   - Update/Delete: No one (immutable)

### Deployment
1. Copy `firestore.rules` content
2. Go to Firebase Console → Firestore → Rules
3. Paste the rules
4. Click "Publish"

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### 1. Configure Root Admin Password
